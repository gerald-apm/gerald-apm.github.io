Hello everyone, my name is Geraldhi Aditya Putra Mahayadnya. You can just call me Gerald. I'm a graduate from Universitas Dinamika (Stikom Surabaya) majoring in Computer Engineering. I'm interested about developing IT Infrastuctures especially in Computer Networking, System Administration, and Internet of Things.

I am currently working at a Banking Company in Indonesia as a System Engineer specialized in Unix and Linux Systems. I organized, deployed, and maintained over 500+ Linux Machines and automated them using Ansible and other tools. API is my best friend when it comes to automation :D

Here are my commonly-used skills at work:

- Linux (Red Hat and Oracle Linux), sometimes Ubuntu comes in play
- Ansible Automation Platform
- Container tools (Docker and Podman)
- Virtualization (Ovirt KVM)
- Observation (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Python (Ingesting API & Logs)
- Bash Scripting
- Solaris (whenever needed to configure old servers :p)
