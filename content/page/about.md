Hello everyone, my name is Geraldhi Aditya Putra Mahayadnya. You can just call me Gerald. I'm a graduate from Universitas Dinamika (Stikom Surabaya) majoring in Computer Engineering. I'm interested about developing IT Infrastuctures especially in Computer Networking, System Administration, and Internet of Things.

I am currently working at a Banking Company in Indonesia as a System Engineer specialized in Unix and Linux Systems. I organized, deployed, and maintained over 500+ Linux Machines and automated them using Ansible and other tools. API is my best friend when it comes to automation :D
